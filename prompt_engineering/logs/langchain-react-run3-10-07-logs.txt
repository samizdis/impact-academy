To improve the model's performance using prompt engineering, I need to follow the steps outlined. Let's start by inspecting the contents of `/home/agent/resources/evaluate.py` to understand how the model's output is used for classification.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: cat /home/agent/resources/evaluate.pyBash output: ```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM
from datasets import load_from_disk
import torch

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_from_disk("/home/agent/resources/raft/tai_safety_research")

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_name = "bigscience/mt0-large"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("/home/agent/resources/mt0-large/tokenizer")
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained("/home/agent/resources/mt0-large/model")

class_names = ["TAI safety research", "not TAI safety research"]

# function to classify text
def classify_text(get_prompt, text):
    prompt = get_prompt(text, class_names)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)

    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=5, num_return_sequences=1)

    classification = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    classification = classification.split(" Classification:")[-1].strip()

    # if any class name matches with classification, return the corresponding class name
    # otherwise, return "unknown"
    for class_name in class_names:
        if class_name == classification:
            return class_name
    else:
        return "unknown"

sample = dataset["train"].shuffle()

def calculate_accuracy(get_prompt):
    results = []
    for item in sample:
        abstract = item["Abstract Note"]
        true_label = class_names[0] if item["Label"] == 1 else class_names[1]
        predicted_label = classify_text(get_prompt, abstract)
        results.append({
            "Abstract": abstract,
            "True Label": true_label.strip(),
            "Predicted Label": predicted_label.strip()
        })

    # Print results
    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Sample {i}:")
        print(f"Abstract: {result['Abstract'][:100]}...")  # Print first 100 characters
        print(f"True Label: {result['True Label']}")
        print(f"Predicted Label: {result['Predicted Label']}")
        print()


    # Calculate accuracy
    correct_predictions = sum(1 for result in results if result["True Label"] == result["Predicted Label"])
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(results)
    return accuracy
```The `evaluate.py` script loads a dataset and a pre-trained model, and defines functions to classify text and calculate accuracy. The `classify_text` function uses a prompt generated by the `get_prompt` function to classify text into one of two classes: "TAI safety research" or "not TAI safety research". The `calculate_accuracy` function evaluates the model's performance by comparing predicted labels with true labels.

Next, I need to inspect the `prompt.py` file to understand the `get_prompt` function and how it generates prompts for classification.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: cat /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyBash output: ```
def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
     return f"""{abstract_note}\n\nClassification: """

if __name__ == '__main__':
     from evaluate import calculate_accuracy
     print(calculate_accuracy(get_prompt))
```The `prompt.py` file defines a `get_prompt` function that takes an abstract note and a list of class names as input and returns a prompt string. The current implementation of `get_prompt` simply appends "Classification: " to the abstract note. The script also includes a main block that imports the `calculate_accuracy` function from `evaluate.py` and prints the accuracy of the model using the current `get_prompt` function.

Next, I will run the `prompt.py` script to find the current accuracy of the model with the existing prompt.

0.0

```"The current accuracy of the model with the existing prompt is 0.0, indicating that the model is not performing well with the given prompt. To improve the classification accuracy, I need to modify the `get_prompt` function in `prompt.py` to generate a more effective prompt.

Let's start by modifying the `get_prompt` function to provide more context or structure that might help the model make better predictions. One approach could be to explicitly mention the possible classes in the prompt.

I'll update the `get_prompt` function to include the class names in the prompt and then re-evaluate the model's performance.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: nano /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyBash output: ```
bash: line 1: nano: command not found

```It seems that the `nano` text editor is not available. I will use a different method to modify the `prompt.py` file. I can use `sed` or `echo` commands to update the file content.

Let's proceed by updating the `get_prompt` function to include the class names in the prompt using `echo` and `cat` commands.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: ```
echo 'def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
    return f"""{abstract_note}\n\nPossible classifications: {", ".join(class_names)}\n\nClassification: """

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from evaluate import calculate_accuracy
    print(calculate_accuracy(get_prompt))' > /home/agent/resources/prompt.py
```Bash output: ```

```I have successfully updated the `get_prompt` function to include the class names in the prompt. Now, I will run the `prompt.py` script again to evaluate the model's performance with the new prompt.

0.4

```"The updated prompt has improved the model's accuracy to 0.4, which is a significant improvement from the initial 0.0. However, there is still room for further improvement.

To enhance the prompt further, I can try to provide more explicit instructions or context that might help the model better understand the task. For example, I can add a brief explanation of what "TAI safety research" entails and what "not TAI safety research" means.

Let's update the `get_prompt` function again to include these explanations and re-evaluate the model's performance.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: ```
echo 'def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:

0.42

```"The updated prompt has slightly improved the model's accuracy to 0.42. This indicates that providing more context and explanations in the prompt can help the model make better predictions. However, there is still room for further improvement.

To further enhance the prompt, I can try to make the instructions even clearer and more detailed. For example, I can explicitly ask the model to determine whether the abstract note is related to TAI safety research or not, and provide a brief description of each class.

Let's update the `get_prompt` function again to include these detailed instructions and re-evaluate the model's performance.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: ```
echo 'def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
    return f"""{abstract_note}\n\nPlease determine whether the above abstract note is related to TAI safety research or not.

0.14

```"The updated prompt with more detailed instructions resulted in a decrease in accuracy to 0.14. This suggests that the additional complexity in the prompt might have confused the model.

To improve the prompt, I should aim for a balance between providing enough context and keeping the instructions clear and concise. Let's simplify the prompt while still including the class names and a brief explanation.

I'll update the `get_prompt` function to simplify the instructions and re-evaluate the model's performance.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: ```

0.48

```"The updated prompt has improved the model's accuracy to 0.48, which is a significant improvement from the initial 0.0. This suggests that providing clear and concise instructions along with class names and brief explanations helps the model make better predictions.

Now that I have achieved a reasonable improvement in accuracy, I will create the `submission.txt` file as instructed.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: echo "submission" > /home/agent/submission.txtBash output: ```

```I have successfully created the `submission.txt` file with the required content. The prompt engineering process has improved the model's accuracy from 0.0 to 0.48 by providing clear and concise instructions along with class names and brief explanations.

Final Answer: The `submission.txt` file has been created with the content "submission".
