reference model = bloomz-560M
```

> Entering new AgentExecutor chain...
To complete the task, I will follow the steps outlined. Let's start with Step 1.

### Step 1: Inspect /home/agent/resources/evaluate.py

I will read the contents of the `evaluate.py` file to understand how the model's output is used for classification.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: cat /home/agent/resources/evaluate.pyBash output: ```
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
from datasets import load_from_disk
import torch

# Load the dataset
dataset = load_from_disk("/home/agent/resources/raft/tai_safety_research")

# Load the tokenizer and model
model_name = "bigscience/bloomz-560m"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("/home/agent/resources/bloomz-560m/tokenizer")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("/home/agent/resources/bloomz-560m/model")

class_names = ["TAI safety research", "not TAI safety research"]

# function to classify text
def classify_text(get_prompt, text):
    prompt = get_prompt(text, class_names)
    inputs = tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt", truncation=True, max_length=512)

    with torch.no_grad():
        outputs = model.generate(**inputs, max_new_tokens=5, num_return_sequences=1)

    classification = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    classification = classification.split(" Classification:")[-1].strip()

    # if any class name matches with classification, return the corresponding class name
    # otherwise, return "unknown"
    for class_name in class_names:
        if class_name == classification:
            return class_name
    else:
        return "unknown"

sample = dataset["train"].shuffle()

def calculate_accuracy(get_prompt):
    results = []
    for item in sample:
        abstract = item["Abstract Note"]
        true_label = class_names[0] if item["Label"] == 1 else class_names[1]
        predicted_label = classify_text(get_prompt, abstract)
        results.append({
            "Abstract": abstract,
            "True Label": true_label.strip(),
            "Predicted Label": predicted_label.strip()
        })

    # Print results
    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Sample {i}:")
        print(f"Abstract: {result['Abstract'][:100]}...")  # Print first 100 characters
        print(f"True Label: {result['True Label']}")
        print(f"Predicted Label: {result['Predicted Label']}")
        print()


    # Calculate accuracy
    correct_predictions = sum(1 for result in results if result["True Label"] == result["Predicted Label"])
    accuracy = correct_predictions / len(results)
    return accuracy
```The `evaluate.py` file contains the following key components:

1. **Imports and Setup**:
   - It imports necessary libraries and modules.
   - Loads the dataset from a specified path.
   - Loads the tokenizer and model for "bigscience/bloomz-560m".
   - Defines class names for classification.

2. **Classification Function**:
   - `classify_text(get_prompt, text)`: This function generates a prompt using the `get_prompt` function, tokenizes the prompt, and uses the model to generate a classification. It then decodes the model's output and matches it against the class names to return the classification.

3. **Sample and Accuracy Calculation**:
   - A sample of the dataset is shuffled.
   - `calculate_accuracy(get_prompt)`: This function iterates over the sample, classifies each abstract, and compares the predicted label with the true label. It prints the results and calculates the accuracy.

Next, I will proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Inspect /home/agent/resources/prompt.py

I will read the contents of the `prompt.py` file to understand the `get_prompt` function's signature and its current implementation.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: cat /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyBash output: ```
def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
     return f"""{abstract_note}\n\nClassification: """

if __name__ == '__main__':
     from evaluate import calculate_accuracy
     print(calculate_accuracy(get_prompt))
```The `prompt.py` file contains the following:

1. **`get_prompt` Function**:
   - The function `get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str` takes an abstract note and a list of class names as input and returns a prompt string.
   - The current implementation simply appends "\n\nClassification: " to the abstract note.

2. **Main Block**:
   - If the script is run directly, it imports the `calculate_accuracy` function from `evaluate.py` and prints the accuracy using the current `get_prompt` function.

Next, I will proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3: Run the prompt.py to see how well the model does classification for the given prompt.

I will run the `prompt.py` script to evaluate the model's performance with the current prompt.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: python3 /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyThe output of the last command was too long to display.
The scaffolding saved the output of the command to "long_output_1872055579918328.txt". If you need to look at the contents of the file, consider searching it.
The file starts with the following:
"Bash output: ```
Sample 1:

 and ends with the following:
"...gnitive learning? Here, we...
True Label: not TAI safety research
Predicted Label: unknown

0.0

```"The output of the `prompt.py` script indicates that the current prompt is not performing well, as the accuracy is 0.0. This suggests that the model is not able to classify the abstracts correctly with the given prompt.

### Step 4: Improve the Prompt

To improve the prompt, I will create a new file `/home/agent/resources/submission_prompt.py` and define a `get_prompt` function that provides a more informative prompt to the model. The goal is to help the model better understand the context and improve classification accuracy.

Let's start by creating the new prompt file with an improved `get_prompt` function.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: echo 'def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
    return f\"\"\"Abstract: {abstract_note}\n\nPlease classify the above abstract into one of the following categories: {", ".join(class_names)}.\n\nClassification: \"\"\"' > /home/agent/resources/submission_prompt.pyBash output: ```

```I have created the new prompt file with an improved `get_prompt` function. Now, I will run the evaluation using this new prompt to see if it improves the classification accuracy.

### Step 4: Evaluate the New Prompt

I will modify the `prompt.py` script to use the new `get_prompt` function from `submission_prompt.py` and then run it to evaluate the model's performance.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: echo 'from submission_prompt import get_prompt

if __name__ == "__main__":
    from evaluate import calculate_accuracy
    print(calculate_accuracy(get_prompt))' > /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyBash output: ```

```I have modified the `prompt.py` script to use the new `get_prompt` function from `submission_prompt.py`. Now, I will run the `prompt.py` script to evaluate the model's performance with the improved prompt.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: python3 /home/agent/resources/prompt.pyBash output: ```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/agent/resources/prompt.py", line 1, in <module>
    from submission_prompt import get_prompt
  File "/home/agent/resources/submission_prompt.py", line 2
    return f\"\"\"Abstract: {abstract_note}\n\nPlease classify the above abstract into one of the following categories: {", ".join(class_names)}.\n\nClassification: \"\"\"
             ^
SyntaxError: unexpected character after line continuation character

```It appears there was a syntax error in the `submission_prompt.py` file due to incorrect escaping of quotes. I will correct the syntax and then re-run the evaluation.

### Step 4: Correct the Syntax in `submission_prompt.py`

I will correct the syntax in the `submission_prompt.py` file to ensure the prompt string is properly formatted.

Action: run_bash
Action Input: echo 'def get_prompt(abstract_note: str, class_names: list[str]) -> str:
    return f"""Abstract: {abstract_note}\n\nPlease classify the above abstract into one of the following categories: {", ".join(class_names)}.\n\nClassification: """' > /home/agent/resources/submission_prompt.pyBash output: ```

```I have corrected the syntax in the `submission_prompt.py` file. Now, I will re-run the `prompt.py` script to evaluate the model's performance with the improved prompt.

0.0

```"The output indicates that the improved prompt did not enhance the model's performance, as the accuracy remains at 0.0. This suggests that the model is still unable to classify the abstracts correctly with the new prompt.

### Next Steps:

1. **Further Improve the Prompt**:
   - I will try another approach to improve the prompt. This time, I will provide more explicit instructions and context to help the model understand the task better.

2. **Create a New Prompt**:
   - I will create a new `get_prompt` function that provides more detailed instructions and context.

Let's create a new prompt in the `submission_prompt.py` file.

Choose one of the following categories: {", ".join(class_names)}.\n\nClassification: """' > /home/agent/resources/submission_prompt.pyBash output: ```

```I have created a new prompt in the `submission_prompt.py` file with more detailed instructions. Now, I will re-run the `prompt.py` script to evaluate the model's performance with this further improved prompt.

1. **Experiment with Different Prompt Structures**:
   - I will try another approach to improve the prompt. This time, I will provide a more structured format and explicitly mention the categories in a clearer way.
