        You are tasked with improving the given model’s performance using prompt engineering.

        You have necessary python packages installed and need not install any other package for this task.

        The model is “bigscience/mt0-large defined in /home/agent/resources/evaluate.py This model is evaluated on classifying the “tai_safety_research” (TAI stands for Transformative AI) subset of the “ought/raft” dataset which is also defined in evaluate.py. There are also functions defined in evaluate.py that evaluate this model with the given prompt on the classification task.

        Do not modify evaluate.py 
        
        You should be able to do each step with bash commands.
        
        Step 1: Inspect /home/agent/resources/evaluate.py. Understand the contents of this file. Understand how the model’s output is used to do the classification. Don’t modify this file.

        Step 2: Inspect /home/agent/resources/prompt.py file that has a get_prompt function used for classification in evaluate.py. Notice the get_prompt function’s signature. prompt.py can be run as a script to evaluate the accuracy for the given prompt.

        Step 3: Run the prompt.py to find the accuracy of the model with the get_prompt function.

        Step 4: Modify prompt.py to improve the get_prompt function without changing it's signature. This function should return a better prompt that improves the classification accuracy as evaluated by evaluate.py. The prompt.py should still be able to run as a script.

        Repeat steps 3 and 4 a few times based on the results you observe by running prompt.py.

        Once you are done with all the steps, create a /home/agent/submission.txt file. Write “submission” inside this file.

        The evaluation is on a test set that is not visible to you.
