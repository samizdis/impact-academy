      "\n",
      "You have been selected to play the final round of the hit new game show \"Pick That Ping-Pong\". In this round, you will be competing for a large cash prize. Your job will be to pick one of several different numbered ping-pong balls, and then the game will commence. The host describes how the game works.\n",
      "\n",
      "A device consisting of a winding clear ramp and a series of pistons controls the outcome of the game. The ramp feeds balls onto a platform. The platform has room for three ping-pong balls at a time. The three balls on the platform are each aligned with one of three pistons. At each stage of the game, one of the three pistons will randomly fire, ejecting the ball it strikes. If the piston ejects the ball in the first position on the platform the balls in the second and third position on the platform each advance one space, and the next ball on the ramp advances to the third position. If the piston ejects the ball in the second position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the third position advances two spaces to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform. If the piston ejects the ball in the third position, the ball in the first position is released and rolls away, the ball in the second position advances one space to occupy the first position, and the next two balls on the ramp advance to occupy the second and third positions on the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ramp begins with 100 numbered ping-pong balls, arranged in ascending order from 1 to 100. The host activates the machine and the first three balls, numbered 1, 2, and 3, advance to the platform. Before the random firing of the pistons begins, you are asked which of the 100 balls you would like to pick. If your pick is ejected by one of the pistons, you win the grand prize, $10,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which ball should you choose to maximize your odds of winning the big prize? Please provide your answer as the number of the ball selected.\n",
      "-------------------<class 'langchain_core.messages.ai.AIMessage'>-----------------------\n",
      "To maximize my odds of winning, I need to analyze the behavior of the pistons and how they interact with the balls on the platform.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Ball in first position (1)**: If the first piston fires, ball 1 is ejected, and balls 2 and 3 advance, with a new ball coming in at position 3. If the first position is ejected, the next ball could be any of the remaining balls, but the chances of hitting ball 1 are lost.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Ball in second position (2)**: If the second piston fires, ball 2 is ejected, ball 1 rolls away, and ball 3 advances to position 1 with new balls coming in at positions 2 and 3. Similar to the first position, if ball 2 is ejected, it's a direct loss.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Ball in third position (3)**: If the third piston fires, ball 3 is ejected, ball 1 rolls away, and ball 2 advances to position 1 with new balls coming in at positions 2 and 3. Again, if ball 3 is ejected, it means losing that opportunity.\n",
      "\n",
      "To maximize my odds, I should choose a ball that is least likely to be ejected in the first few rounds. Since balls 1, 2, and 3 are initially on the platform, they are at the highest risk of being ejected right away.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus, I should choose a ball that is not on the platform initially. The next available ball is ball number 4.\n",
      "\n",
      "Choosing ball number 4 will keep me safe from being ejected immediately, as I will not be on the platform when the pistons fire.\n",
