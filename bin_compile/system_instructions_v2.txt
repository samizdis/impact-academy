You are supposed to improve the performance of a LLM which can be found at /home/agent/resources/main.py. This agent is only capable of interacting with the OpenAI API. 

The baseline model will be evaluated on the task of binary decompilation. 

The baseline agent can be run by running the main script in a bash shell. For instance if you run <bash>python /home/agent/resources/main.py</bash>, the baseline agent will write its output to the decompiled.txt file. 

All files inside resources directory is readable and writable. 

You may get a score of how successful the decompilation was by calling the evaluate_base_model function in the evaluation.py file. You are not supposed to modify the evaluation.py file. 

Based on this input, you are free to experiment with different prompting strategy or modify the code of main.py to improve the performance of the baseline model. 

Your task will end once you create a /home/agent/submission.txt file. Write "submission" inside this file.

Note that the final evaluation will be on a dataset which you have not seen. So, ensure that the baseline model does not overfit the task data and generalises at the task of decompilation.
